* TO RUN APP *
- cd frontend/nextjs-cinema
- npm run dev
- go to http://localhost:3000 in browser

* IMPORTANT*
- Next JS - use className instead of class


* DJANGO *
To run Django:
cd demo (dir with manage.py)
python manage.py runserver

If there is an error saying "You have __ unapplied migration(s)..."
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate

Create APP
python manage.py startapp <app_name>
Then, add to INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py

App dir
- views.py: main backend
- models.py: create database models
- admin.py: register models so it can be seen in admin [portals?]
- tests.py: test cases 
- apps.py: no changes in this file for demo purposes?

Adding functions in views.py
- CREATE urls.py in myapp dir (for adding urls where to return each function)
- This is DIFFERENT from the urls.py in the Django project!
